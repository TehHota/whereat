A social media app about the future, not the past.

## App Mission Statement
Our mission is to unite students of all interests using the format of social media in order to foster community through physical activity at Biola University.
## Scope:
This project will produce a visually functional app that will provide example posts for users to interact with. This app will not provide backend functionality nor will it provide functional notification settings. Notification design will be shown as an example of what a notification would look like. The example posts will reflect posts which the example users might post. The app will include 4 activities, login/signup, main feed, post creation, and settings. Each activity's layout and design will be visible. Posts created will add nothing to the feed. Biola students are the only users.
